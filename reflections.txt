You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

          Personally some of the newer things I've learned were the new pathways for files and the figure elements. I've also learned how the mockup process (or at least a hint of it) during this part of the program. The easiest bits were the structure elements (p,h1, a href, etc..). The difficult parts was the figure element strategy, which I research on while learning and learned a new way to image and caption. The problem solving strategies I've learned were to reference, review, and research my code and the pathways that I did for my workflow. Being a simple exercise, I found most of the help from the definitions of the codes.
